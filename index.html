<p>I am a spatial data scientist and cartographer with interdisciplinary affiliations through criminology (crime mapping), behavioral geography (territoriality), and political science (boundaries) with research at the intersection of human-{map}-environment.<br />
<br />
I have a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with a minor in Applied Computer Science (UCF), a Master of Science in Management Information Systems (UCF), and a Ph.D. in Geography (FSU).<br />
<br />
<u>Ongoing METHODS/projects</u>:<br />
<strong>1. MAP USABILITY/TIME GEOGRAPHY:</strong><br />
a) Challenges of mobility in crime mapping (e.g., policing, cybercrime, and illegal logging)<br />
b) Space-time exploration of early policing call logs and the urban landscape<br />
c) Space-time constraints and election laws<br />
<br />
<strong>2. PARTICIPITORY GIS:</strong><br />
a) Participatory mapping approaches in public/shared spaces (e.g., beach access and viewsheds)<br />
b) Redistricting (participatory mapping and effects of gerrymandering)<br />
<br />
<strong>3. BAYES NET/GIS INTEGRATION:</strong><br />
a) Public Outreach: Mapping Ancestry Podcast<br />
b) Bayes/GIS exploration of risk and amenity in coastal home prices<br />
<br />
<strong>Student advising:</strong><br />
Support/advisor to students on projects overlapping my research interest and human-{map}-environment topic in general (e.g., water quality and hurricane impacts)<br />
