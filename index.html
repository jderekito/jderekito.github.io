<p>
	My research broadly focuses on the intersection of human geography (particularly legal geography) and GIScience (specifically cartography) with urban planning and policy applications.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Ongoing projects/themes:
	<br/>
	1. Challenges of mobility in crime mapping (e.g., policing, cybercrime, and illegal logging)
	<br/>
	2. Territory and access to public/shared spaces (beach access and viewsheds)
	<br/>
	3. Effects of gerrymandering
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Evolving public outreach project:
	<br/>
	<!--Mapping ancestry - A podcast on mapping and ancestry research -->
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Student advising:
	<br/>
	Support/advisor to students on projects overlapping my research projects and human-environment research in general (e.g., water quality and hurricane impacts)
